- **Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that follows the divide-and-conquer approach. It works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.**



## Algorithm
- **Divide: Divide the list or array recursively into two halves until it can no longer be divided.**
- **Conquer: Each subarray is sorted individually using the merge sort algorithm.**
- **Merge: The sorted subarrays are merged back together in sorted order. The process continues until all elements from both subarrays have been merged.**



## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity is `O[n*log(n)]` where `n` is the size of the array.**



## Interview Questions 
- **Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array.**
- **Merge sort is not an in-place sorting algorithm. Merge sort requires additional memory to store the merged sub-arrays during the sorting process.**
