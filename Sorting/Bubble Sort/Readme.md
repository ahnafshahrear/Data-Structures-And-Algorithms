## Algorithm
- **Traverse from left, compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed on the right side.**
- **In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.**
- **This process is then continued to find the second largest, place it and so on until the data is sorted.**


## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity is `O[n^2]` where `n` is the size of the array.**
