- **Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.**



## Algorithm
- **Traverse from left, compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed on the right side.**
- **In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first.**
- **This process is then continued to find the second largest, place it and so on until the data is sorted.**



## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity is `O[n^2]` where `n` is the size of the array.**



## Interview Questions 
- **It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.**
- **Bubble sort algorithm is an in-place algorithm.**
