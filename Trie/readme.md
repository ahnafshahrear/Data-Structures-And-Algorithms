## What is Trie Data Structure? 
- **Trie data structure is defined as a Tree based data structure that is used for storing some collection of strings & performing efficient search operations on them.**

- **The Trie data structure, also known as a Prefix Tree, is a tree-like data structure used for efficient storing & searching of words.
  It is commonly used for implementing dictionaries & autocomplete features, making it a fundamental component in many search algorithms.**

- **Trie data structure follows some property that, if two strings have a common prefix then they will have the same ancestor in the trie.**

- **Trie data structure can be used to sort a collection of strings alphabetically as well as search whether a string with a given prefix is present in the trie or not.**

- **Insertion, Searching, Deletion Time Complexity: `O(n)`**

- **Applications:**
  - **Dictionaries, Autocomplete Features, Spell Checkers, Longest Prefix Matching Algorithms etc.**
