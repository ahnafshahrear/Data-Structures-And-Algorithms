## What is Binary Search
**Binary search is a search algorithm used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target value is found or the interval is empty. The search interval is halved by comparing the target element with the middle value of the search space.**
<br><br>
**Time Complexity of Binary Search is `O[log(n)]` where n is the size of the array of sorted numbers**
<br><br>
**To apply Binary Search algorithm:**
- **The data structure must be sorted.**
- **Access to any element of the data structure should take constant time.** <br>
